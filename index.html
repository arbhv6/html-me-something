           &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The hobby I've had the longest would be playing video games. I've played on numerous consoles over the years including Playstation, N64, Gameboy, Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox One and PC.  I currently enjoy playing on my Xbox One.  The games I currently play are the new Call of Duty and Overwatch.

           &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A few years ago, I picked up an interest in gardening. Currently, I'm growing onions, tomatos, peppers, and kale.  Also, I planted two raspeberry and two blackberry plants near my house.

           &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;My wife and myself purchased our home in 2016.  Since then, we've noticed several items around the house that we would like to improve.  The first big addition to our home was a composite deck to entertain guests and relax.  Currently I'm working on the yard.  Specifically, killing the weeds and getting the lawn greener are my top concerns.
